# Wayfair-Delivery-Guarantee-Campaign-Analysis
A Tableau-Based Business Intelligence &amp; Data Storytelling Project

🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a Tableau analytics project analyzing the effectiveness of Wayfair’s “Ships in Time” delivery guarantee campaign during the holiday season. The project focuses on customer behavior, revenue impact, platform performance, and campaign effectiveness, using interactive dashboards and calculated fields to answer real-world business questions.

The analysis emphasizes storytelling with data, translating complex transactional datasets into actionable marketing and strategy insights.

📌 This was a collaborative group project completed as part of an academic analytics course.

🎯 Business Objectives

The project answers two key business questions:

1. Did customers who saw the delivery guarantee (Group B) spend more per order than those who did not (Group A)?

Compared average revenue per order

Analyzed category-wise and platform-wise revenue distribution

Evaluated the impact of the guarantee on purchasing behavior

2. Did the campaign successfully increase last-minute holiday shopping?

Tracked browsing and purchasing behavior leading up to Christmas

Compared trend lines between control and treatment groups

Assessed whether delivery assurance created urgency or reduced it

📈 Key Analytical Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Tableau

Calculated Fields for accurate net sales:

Net Quantity = Purchased Qty − Returned Qty − (Cancelled × Purchased Qty)


FIXED LOD Expressions for revenue and order-level aggregation

Customer Segmentation:

New visitors

Returning customers

Acquired members

Activated users

Platform comparison (Desktop vs Mobile Web)

Trend analysis for last-minute shopping behavior

📊 Insights & Findings
🔹 Revenue Behavior

Group A generated higher total revenue

Group B showed higher average revenue per order, indicating stronger purchase confidence

The guarantee contributed 30–40% of revenue across categories

🔹 Category & Platform Trends

Living Room Furniture and Outdoor & Storage drove the most revenue during Christmas

Desktop and mobile platforms performed almost equally, reinforcing omnichannel importance

🔹 Campaign Effectiveness

The delivery guarantee did not increase last-minute shopping

Customers exposed to the guarantee tended to spread purchases over time

Reduced urgency may have unintentionally lowered last-minute conversion

💡 Strategic Recommendations

Replace expensive delivery guarantees with targeted discounts on underperforming inventory

Use urgency-based messaging instead of reassurance-based messaging

Reinforce reminders earlier in the holiday cycle to influence timing behavior

Maintain strong omnichannel presence across desktop and mobile
